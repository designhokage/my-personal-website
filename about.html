            <p>As a kid I wanted to become a Psychologist, then a Medical Doctor, to studying Botany at the University. 
                One thing led to another and I'm currently studying New Media Design at Jonkoping University in Sweden.</p> 
            <p>I believe that design must support functionality, and that design is more than just choosing colours, typefaces, shapes and images. 
                Good design works to present information in such a way as to support the information <br> it presents.</p> 
            <p>I enjoy listening to music, watching sports, playing fantasy premier league and playing FIFA.</p>
            <p>Feel free to look at my <a href="index.html">portfolio</a> and don't hesitate to 
                <a href="mailto:emmanueledigbe@yahoo.com">contact me</a> if you think I can be of service to you. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
